        animeloop-cli
      </a>. As you can see, the fragments that are currently generated are not much ideal, and the algorithms are constantly being slowly optimized.
    </p>
    <p>
      This site has a set of automated procedures (automator) in the background server running at day and night, the speed for generating new content is about two season anime per one day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Currrently the new content source to generate provided by administrator manually, and in the future, the source will be added by automator from dmhy.org etc with a full Automator.

    <p>
      Site development plan, at this stage, the main focus on the development of server automation, the goal is high stability in the automatic operation.
